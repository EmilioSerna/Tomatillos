# Tomatillos

Tomatillos it's a project with one and only purpose, to teach me how to work with: ReactJS, Flask and simultaneously, deploy it in Heroku.

Tomatillos could be a 'copy-cat' of Rotten Tomatoes, of course, with no purpose but to learn said technologies.

## Techonlogies used

As I said earlier, Tomatillos is powered up by ReactJS, Flask, and to use for the sake of learning some Database Manager, will use PostgreSQL.

ReactJS will be the front-end of the site, as Flask will be the back-end, where there will be all the API RESTful written.

### Features

There will be,

- a catalog of movies and series, perhaps even, media in general
- accounts, as a verified critic, and as a regular user
- ratings in any media available, like in Rotten Tomatoes, these will be differentiated by the type of user
